    "With my schedule packed full of activities, you will seldom find me standing still. I am always looking for novel exciting ideas, new places to explore, and opportunities to hangout with friends! Creative design processes often intrigue me, and I find Architectural work very fulfilling. I am a believer in the principles of Form following Function and coexisting with nature, and hope these ideals will shine through in my work."
