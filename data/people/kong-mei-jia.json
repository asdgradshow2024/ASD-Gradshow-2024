    "Hello! I am an aspiring architect who is consistently seeking opportunities to deepen my perspectives on takes the world has to offer, for me to nurture my empathy in architecture and become a designer with purpose. With the ever-changing social contexts and needs surrounding us, with a focus on sustainability and intensifying the old into new experiences, I am passionate about bringing people from all walks of life together through architectural forms.",
    "I love surrounding myself with nature, photography and chasing sunsets. I may be a lil too quiet when you first meet me, but I am one of the noisiest with my friends. I hope you enjoy browsing through this website as much as I enjoyed designing it! hehe :)"
