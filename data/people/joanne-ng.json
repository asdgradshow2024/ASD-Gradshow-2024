    "I am most passionate about how urban spaces can be pragmatically designed to improve city living, and I am also interested in how spatial and urban identities can be expressed or enhanced. I am also a lover of nature and I believe that spatial design has the power to help people reconnect with nature, eventually rebuilding our relationship with the environment."
