        "The Singapore Pavilion at Osaka Expo 2025 critiques disposable culture, focusing on fast fashion waste. Using recycled textiles crocheted into tensile structures, it embodies the theme \"Designing Future Society for Our Lives\" and sub-theme \"Saving Lives.\" Visitors contribute to the architecture by adding crocheted panels, enhancing community involvement. The pavilion features areas like \"Textile Tangle,\" demonstrating the excessive waste impact, and workshops teaching crochet from waste, promoting circularity and sustainable practices."
