        "With community as a foundation that roots the concept of this new hub, we envision a main spine of public spaces that encourage active lifestyles, through physical activity and continuous learning. This spine branches out into smaller spines that connects to other facilities.",
        "Arising from the changing, diverse and growing demographic of the Clementi area, we wanted to have an all-day space that is appealing to all ages. Sports facilities are interspersed with informal rest areas, which form nodes of socialisation. Specifically, we want to spark meaningful connections between the seniors and the younger generation through strategic planning of spaces."
