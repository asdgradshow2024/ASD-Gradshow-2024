        "The retail-centric MRT corridor is characterised by a contrast of modern transport infrastructure and outdated commerce. Rumah toko jalan, a combination of the words 'shophouse' and 'street', envisions the adaptive reuse of the prevalent shophouse typology along the main street of Jalan Panglima Polim, transforming the walled-up rumah toko into an open, inviting, vibrant retail space. By implementing a kit of parts, including a large central void, lift, linear staircase and open stepped roof deck, the proposal improves through-block access and pedestrian walkability, while creating replicable retail nodes along the main street to improve street-long retail engagement, transforming the retail experience along the MRT corridor into a thriving commercial street."

        "This project offers access into the kampungs through a hybrid of linear marketplace and domestic place, and is best placed along the main street at entrances to the kampung, which lie south to Blok A station. It is a mega structure that's 100m by 24m Long. This proposal hopes to transform the retail experience along the MRT corridor and turn it into a thriving commercial street."
