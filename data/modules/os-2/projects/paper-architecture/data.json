        "The Singapore Pavilion at the 2025 World Expo stands as a reflection of the World Expo as an architectural mega event by tackling the rising concerns of wastefulness, while at the same time bringing forth Singapore's efforts in championing sustainable architecture.",
        "The pavilion starts off as a naked landscape sheltered by a paper+PVA composite structure that will degrade over time as it weathers. Meanwhile, visitors of the pavilion come together to nurture the landscape and together they build a garden that will stand in place of the initial shell of the pavilion.",
        "The pavilion challenges the current state of temporary mega structures and also brings forth the Singaporean identity of nation building, sharing the true experience of building a garden city with people from all walks of life and cultures."
