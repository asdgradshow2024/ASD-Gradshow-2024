      "description": [
        "Taking inspiration from Pacita Abad's winding journey as an artist, this museum is designed using circles as the base geometry and aims to create smooth transitional spaces between programmes.",
        "Though a singular structure, the satellite MoMA contains a multitude of different programs. Individual programmes are first marked out using circles of various sizes depending on the amount of space required. Programmes are categorized into front-stage and back-stage programmes depending on the degree of privacy. Spaces for back-stage programmes are created by offsetting a smaller circle within a larger one. Spaces are then created by merging circles using a concave and convex system used throughout this museum.",
        "Taking circulation into consideration, the circles are arranged and merged in a way that the paths taken by visitors will become intuitive by following the curved walls, without defined entrances and exits. Circulation is controlled by narrowing and widening walkways, designing a winding journey for visitors as they explore the museum, while eliminating the use of static doors."
