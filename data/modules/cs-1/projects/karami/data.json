        "Engaging the public and drawing interest in contemporary art lies at the heart of the museum, aiming to be an inclusive place that celebrates diversity. In designing the museum, circulation is carefully considered – walking out from the underpass, pedestrians can look through a hole in the museum, where they can see the happenings in the public performance area. Intriguing them, they travel further down to the entrance of the museum, big and welcoming. The atrium holds a café with a view, a space where people can roam freely and view most parts of the museum. The museum as a whole is a series of steps, spiraling upwards. However, the entrance is neither at the top nor bottom, but somewhere in the middle, which might echo that art is for everyone. When you enter, you face a bifurcated pathway. The spatial effect of the scalloping of walls creates a texturally interesting space, a pleasing play of light, further engaging the public. The ability to see between different floors creates a sense of inclusivity.",
